# Times-tables-visualization
The pattern is created by multiplication of points in circle and connecting them with lines. It has a close relationship with Mendelbrot set. Implementation of visualization is in processing.org environment.

# Discreption
Times tables is a circle with points around it. Those points are connected to each other. The connection is between a point and multiplacation of it which is a sequential order of it in circle. Multilpier 2 creates the shape of Mendelbrot set or so called Cardio shape. The multiplier of times table can be represented in Mendelbrot formula z^multiplication + c as its exponent.

# Patterns
The program is a simulation of creating patterns inside the circle. The initial number of points in a circle is 100 and multiplier is 2.
